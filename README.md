See the slides in the *Slides* folder for introduction.

# Setup

# Plan

As time is very limited and there is a lot to learn, we'll aim to do something simple which will cover a few of the main Unity workflows. We'll make a simple mini-game which resembles an infinite runner, where they player most jump over a hurdle.

# Stage 1 - set up environment

We're going to make the following. The brown object is the floor. The yellow object is a hurdle.
